		<p><strong>Singapore:</strong> A great looking and well-maintained city (I hesitate calling it a ‘Country’). Everything just seems perfect at first, but then,</p>
<p><strong>My Opinion -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Weather sucks (as it’s just around the equator)</li>
<li>Things are way too systematic, which eventually end up being predictive and boring.</li>
<li>Everything is over-priced. Be it fines, tarrifs, whatever…Sometimes, it feels like you’re being looted, legally. I really don’t understand the need for creating this artificial demand for things. (Example - A Cigarette lighter in US/India costs just about $0.2 and it costs $1+ here. Why? Does that pump out any magical shit? Beer costs 4x, Cigarettes 2x…)</li>
</ul>
<p>The list can go on and on…</p>
<p>But, to draw a conclusion -</p>
<p>“Singapore is good for taking pics and showing off on insta. I stayed there for 3 months (<em>NUS Intern</em>). I really regret going there and wasting my summer-time in Singapore. Everything looks great from the outside, but deep inside, it’s just something really worthless.”</p>
<p><strong>One last thing -</strong></p>
<p>Dear Singapore,</p>
<p>Given the size of your city/nation, please understand it’s way too easier to maintain it with respect to the real ‘countries’ out there. So, I don’t think it’s legit to rank/compare this city/country amongst others in terms of cleanliness or whatever. You’re merely just a sentosa island to rest of the world.</p>
<p>Singapore has a pernicious culture that permits discrimination. This is why landlords can state “No Indians, No PRCs” in their adverts with impunity in Singapore, whereas such outrageous discrimination would subject them to prosecution in Western countries. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26832115">'No Indians No PRCs': Singapore's rental discrimination problem - BBC News</a></p>
<p>By the way, smug Singaporeans think they are so superior , and are in desperate need of differentiating themselves from Chinese citizens, thereby inventing a unique way of referring to Chinese citizens as “PRCs”, often used in a derisive tone. No other country on this planet refers to Chinese citizens as “PRCs” (of course, PRC is the abbreviation for the full name of China; but no other country use this abbreviation as a demonym). Thank you Singaporeans for making us feel so special.</p>
<p>Singapore is hypocritical. It uses the notion of Westernization when it suits them, but condemns it when it does not. For instance, they adopt English as a working language because they claim this enables them to do business with everyone in the world. Indeed, this has helped the tiny island. However, they refuse to repeal the hateful sodomy law because, well, they say that equal rights on the basis of sexual orientation is a Western cultural war (I am quoting the words of the hypocritical Lee Hsien Loong), which Singapore should not get itself into. This is ridiculous because sodomy law is not native to Asia. Again, this speaks to the larger discriminatory culture in Singapore.</p>
<p>Another example demonstrating Singapore’s hypocrisy is its immigration policy. On one hand, the Singapore government congratulates itself on being transparent. On the other hand, it has one of the most non-transparent systems for evaluating immigration applications. Granted, immigration is not an entitlement, but most developed countries adopt a transparent evaluation system using objective criteria such as age, language proficiency, education and skilled work experience, without regard to race or country of origin. Singapore is a different story. We do not know the metrics by which Singapore reviews immigration applications, but we do know that Malaysian Chinese can get Singapore immigration easily, whereas Indians can pretty much forget about it, other things being equal. This speaks to its discriminatory culture, lack of transparency, and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>And I am sickened every time the Singapore media and Singapore government go gaga over some questionable rankings which supposedly show that Singapore schools are good and its pupils brilliant. One ranking even showed that the National University of Singapore was better than John Hopkins University, which is just laughable. But nonetheless, Singaporeans and the Singapore government enjoy indulging in this mutually masturbatory exercise. “Oh yeah, we are great, oh yeah”, they moan. But it is truly laughable.</p>
<p>Lastly, this is a small island whose people have tinier hearts. Whenever someone says or does something that apparently offends them, Singaporeans SCREAM for their pound of flesh (which is why this answer is anonymous!). Remember the case of Sun Xu, a student at NUS who merely complained in his social media account about some Singaporean man giving him nasty stares after accidentally brushing against his shoulder. The response: Singaporeans screamed that the student be dismissed from his program. The result? The young man was forced by the Singapore government to withdraw from his studies. A more recent case was an Australian man who complained that he could not play Pokemon in Singapore. Again, Singaporeans demanded that he be fired (and he WAS!). Such vengeful people, with no magnanimity, and a very conceived view of themselves.</p>
<p>I am so glad that I will get out of this place for good, soon, and settle elsewhere.</p>
